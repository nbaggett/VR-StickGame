Lab08 Nicholas Baggett

This is my submission for lab 08. I really put a ton of work into this
one so I would love it if you would play it. It was developed for the Oculus Rift though so I'm not sure
if it will work with a Vive. If not, I can submit a playthrough video. I used free assets from the
asset store for the environment, and I used SteamVR for the hand pressence and teleportation with
some modification to both. I wrote the locomotion script myself and did the voice acting.

CONTROLS:
Left joystick for smooth locomotion - click it to teleport
Right joystick forward for teleportation
A or X to Jump
Side grab button to grab
